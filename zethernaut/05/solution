the issue in this contract is that the changeOwner is changing the ownership
if the msg.sender doesn't match the tx.origin
We just have to call this contract with an other contract and pass our address
as argument

_owner will be our address passed as parameter
tx.origin will be the address of the smart contract as EVM get the address at the top of the stack
So we go into the if and become owner of the contract
